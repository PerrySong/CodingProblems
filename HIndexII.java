     *
     * Given an array of citations in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

         According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than hcitations each."

         Example:

         Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
         Output: 3
         Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
         received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
         Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
         two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
         Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
